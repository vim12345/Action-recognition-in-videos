# Action-recognition-in-videos

# Description:
Action recognition refers to identifying and classifying actions (e.g., jumping, waving, running) from video sequences. This project uses a pretrained deep learning model for action recognition, leveraging spatiotemporal patterns in frames. We'll use TorchVision's pre-trained models (e.g., r3d_18) trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset for real-world video action classification.


# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Leverages a pretrained action recognition model (R(2+1)D-18)

* Processes videos using temporal frame sampling

* Classifies actions with output probabilities over 400 real-world activities
